# NSGA_deployement

We used NSGA-II and other proposed algorithm (called OPS) to provide the best positions of sensors in building.
Our goal is to maximaze the sensing coverage and minimize the number of nodes with considering the k-connectivity and impact of obstacles.
With the source code "NSGA_deployment-JAVA", that is programmed through JAVA language, the devloper can see the deplyement of solutions in the building.

How to use?
1- The devloper sets all the configurations (NSGA-II parameters and the structure of building) in the file nsga.c.
2- Many solusions will be proposed. Chose an optimal one.
3- Put the solution on "NSGA_deployment-JAVA" to see our deplyement.
